# AI Customer Support Bot Trainer

## Overview

Welcome to the **AI Customer Support Bot Trainer** project! This tool is designed to create an intelligent customer support chatbot by scraping website data and files, processing the information, and training a robust support system tailored to your website's needs. Leveraging advanced technologies like **Groq API**, **Puppeteer** for web scraping, and **Firebase** for data storage and user authentication, this project aims to enhance customer interactions and streamline support processes.

This project is developed as part of **Challenge 3.0 Hackathon**, demonstrating the integration of cutting-edge AI technologies to solve real-world customer support challenges.

## Features

- **Automated Web Scraping**: Utilize Puppeteer to crawl and extract relevant data from your website, ensuring the chatbot has access to up-to-date information.
- **Intelligent Training**: Employ Groq API's advanced models to train the chatbot, enabling it to understand and respond accurately to customer queries.
- **Secure Data Storage**: Use Firebase to store scraped data, user interactions, and manage secure login/authentication processes.
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrate the trained chatbot into your existing website or support channels.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle increasing volumes of data and user interactions without compromising performance.
- **Customizable Responses**: Tailor the chatbot's responses to align with your brand's voice and customer service policies.

## Technologies Used

- **[Groq API](https://groq.com/)**: Advanced AI models for training intelligent chat responses, optimized for high-performance processing.
- **[Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/)**: Node.js library for automated web scraping and data extraction.
- **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)**: Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform for data storage, authentication, and real-time database management.
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: JavaScript runtime environment for building the backend services.
- **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)**: Web framework for Node.js to handle API routes and server-side logic.
- **[React.js](https://reactjs.org/)**: Front-end library for building user interfaces and managing the chatbot's frontend.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or later)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Git**

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-customer-support-bot-trainer.git
   cd ai-customer-support-bot-trainer
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following environment variables:
     ```env
     FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
     FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
     FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your_project_id.firebaseio.com
     FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
     FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
     FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
     FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

     GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
     ```
   - Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase and Groq API credentials.

4. **Run the Application**:
   - To start the server:
     ```bash
     npm run server
     ```
   - To start the React front-end:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.



## How It Works

1. **Web Scraping with Puppeteer**:
   - The scraper module uses Puppeteer to navigate through your website, extracting relevant data such as FAQs, product information, support articles, and more.
   - Extracted data is cleaned and structured for optimal use in training the chatbot.

2. **Data Storage in Firebase**:
   - Scraped data is securely stored in Firebase's real-time database.
   - Firebase Authentication manages user access and ensures that only authorized personnel can modify or view sensitive data.

3. **Training the Chatbot with Groq API**:
   - The Groq API processes the stored data to train the chatbot.
   - The model learns to understand user queries and generate accurate, context-aware responses based on the scraped information.

4. **Integration and Deployment**:
   - The trained chatbot is integrated into your website's front-end using React.js.
   - Users can interact with the chatbot in real-time, receiving instant support and answers to their queries.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can:

- **Initiate Web Scraping**:
  - Trigger the scraping process to update the chatbot's knowledge base with the latest website content.
  
- **Monitor Training Progress**:
  - View logs and status updates to ensure the chatbot is training correctly with the latest data.
  
- **Interact with the Chatbot**:
  - Test the chatbot's responses through the front-end interface to ensure accuracy and relevance.
  
- **Manage Data and Users**:
  - Use Firebase's dashboard to oversee data storage, user authentication, and access controls.
