            </h2>
            <p>
                Create photography with artificial intelligence by creating your own AI model. Upload a set of just 10
                to 20 photos in a diverse range of places, settings, and times. By inputting these images into your
                model, you're teaching it to recognize and replicate it.<br>
                <br>
                You only need to train your model once which takes about 30 minutes. Then you can take infinite photos
                with it.

                How does Photo AI's AI Photo Generator work? </h4>
            <p>
                Photo AI lets you upload selfies, create AI models and then generate AI photos with them. We teach the
                AI how you look and then it's able to generate photorealistic images of you. You can put yourself in
                different settings, with different outfits, doing different actions, with different expressions. And
                best of all, you can do all this from your laptop or phone without having to pay an expensive
                photographer $100s or $1000s.<br>
                <br>
                After sign up you get access to Photo AI's studio which lets you use our photo shoot preset templates,
                write prompts or copycat photos of other people, to generate anything you can think of.
